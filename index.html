        My 8 year old had some fun with number substitution codes.
        He also has a fondness for super-hero stories that feature anthropomorphized, ninja ice cream cones, who live in Iceville, Antarctica, and battle a ring of villains led by the nefarious Hot Plate.
      </p>
      <p>
      One day, I left a note for him that said something, via a simple <a href="steps/01-numbers.html">number substitution</a> cipher.
      It was no problem to figure it out. The next message was encoded the same way, but said that he'd need to subtract one next time, and it included his name as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, there was a message, from the ice cream cones, that said:
        <blockquote><pre> 4  2 15    26 16 22    20  6 15  5

15 16 20  9    21 16

10  4  6 23 10 13 13  6?

13 16 16 12    16 22 21     7 16 19     1!</pre></blockquote> ("NOSH" is my son's alter-ego hero. Or, one of his alter-egos.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, there was a handwritten message:
        <blockquote>Hi!<br>We just found this note. I think hot plate left it, but we can't read it. Can you decode it?<br>From,<br>Red Ice Cream Cone</blockquote>
        With this <a href="steps/03-rot13.html">rot13</a> attachment:
